this was made so i could reuse a haas control panel. it uses a 11x13 keyboard matrix. 
i have included arduino code for a mega and pico. the wiring on the hass panel is from
top down 1-24.   so first 11 are the rows 
one py program lets you test the input and the other is for making the map of the keys used.
this can be used on any matrix panel .
